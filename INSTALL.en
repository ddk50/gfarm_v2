=======================================
Gfarm installation from the source code
=======================================

This distribution is fully tested on Linux.  The building tests were done
on NetBSD, and Solaris.

This section describes how to build Gfarm binaries from the source
distribution.  You can skip this document if you use a binary
distribution.

To build the Gfarm system, the OpenSSL library and either the OpenLDAP
library, or the PostgreSQL library are required.  Regarding RPM
packages and Debian packages for them, see required package section
below.

The following is the installation procedure for the Gfarm system.
Please use GNU make on operating systems other than Linux and NetBSD.

	% ./configure [options]
	% make
	% su
	Password:
	# make install

Options for configure:

  --with-openldap=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for OpenLDAP.  When this
  option is not specified, the installation directory is searched for
  automatically.


  --with-postgresql=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for PostgreSQL.  When this
  option is not specified, the installation directory is searched for
  automatically.


  --with-openssl=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for OpenSSL.  The default
  directory is /usr.


  --with-globus=directory

  Specifies an installation directory for the Globus Toolkit to utilize the
  GSI authentication  method.  When a directory is not specified, the
  environment variable, GLOBUS_LOCATION is used.  This is optional.
  The flavor of the Globus library is searched for automatically.
  If you need to specify a flavor, specify it with the
  --with-globus-flavor=flavor option.


  --without-mtsafe-netdb

  Specifies if either getaddrinfo(3) or getnameinfo(3) library function
  is not multi-thread safe.


  --prefix=directory

  Specifies a destination directory for installation.  The default is
  /usr/local directory.  This is optional.


  --sysconfdir=directory

  Specifies a directory where the ``gfarm2.conf'' configuration file is
  located.  The default is the ``etc'' directory under the directory
  specified in the above --prefix option.  This document assumes
  that --sysconfdir=/etc is specified.  This is optional.


  --enable-voms

  Enables to compile the gfvoms-sync command to synchronize Gfarm
  group membership with VOMS (Virtual Organization Membership Service)
  servers.  This option requires Python and ZSI (Zolera SOAP
  Infrastructure).
  This is optional.


  --enable-xmlattr

  Enables XML extended attribute feature that can be queried by the
  XML Path Language (XPath).  For details, see manual pages of gfxattr
  and gffindxmlattr.  This option requires postgresql-8.3 or
  later that configures with the --with-libxml option.  See
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/install-procedure.html for
  details.  The -X option is also required to config-gfarm when
  setting up the Gfarm file system.
  This is optional.

  --enable-linuxkernel
  Enables to compile the Gfarm kernel driver on linux kernel 2.6.

When you need to specify a compiler program explicitly, use the
environment variable, CC.  This is an example using gcc.

	% env CC=gcc ./configure [options]
