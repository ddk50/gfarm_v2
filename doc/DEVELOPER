		Tools for developing Gfarm file system

This document describes tools to develop Gfarm file system.

* GNU Autoconf

If you update 'configure', use GNU Autoconf version 2.68.


* XSLT processor

Documents of Gfarm programs, library functions and configuration files
are written in the DocBook XML format.  HTML and manpage editions of
the documents are generated automatically from DocBook by XSLT
processor.

We currently use the open-source XSLT processor 'xsltproc' to create
HTML and manpage editions.  HTML and manpage files generated by other
processors are essentially equivalent if the same stylesheet is used,
but they may contain trivial differences; newline positions, amount of
whitespace, and so on.  Since those differences cause wasteful changes
to the source repository of Gfarm, we recommend you to use 'xsltproc'.

Many operating systems provide 'xsltproc' and DocBook stylesheets as
software packages.  On Red Hat Linux (and its variants), the package
names are:

	libxslt
	docbook-style-xsl

On Debian Linux (and its variants), the package names are:

	xsltproc
	docbook-xsl

Install the packages and their dependencies.
