	How to run tests with gfruntest

Requirements
============
In the following description we assume an Unix user named 'test_user'
executes testcases with gfruntest.

 * test_user must be registered as a Gfarm user.
 * test_user should be able to log on to remote hosts by ssh with
   no password (using ssh-agent is recommended).
 * In some tests, test_user should be listed in /etc/sudoers with
   NOPASSWD tag like follows:

	test_user	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL

 * In some tests, test_user need to be in gfarmroot/gfarmadm Gfarm group.

Create gfservice.conf file
==========================
Since gfruntest invokes gfservice command, the configuration file of
gfservice ('$HOME/.gfservice' by default) is required to execute
testcases with 'gfruntest'.  See gfservice.conf(5) for more details.

Execute gfruntest
=================
To execute a testcase with gfruntest, type:

	% gfruntest <testcase name>

where <testcase name> is a shell script under the following directory:

	$datadir/gfarm/systest/testcases/

Note that each '::' in <testcase name> is replaced with '/'.
For example, the testcase name 'aa::bb:cc' corresponds with the script

	$datadir/gfarm/systest/testcases/aa/bb/cc

'-d' (debug), '-f' (specify configuration file) and '-k' (setup key)
options are passed to 'gfservice'.

	% gfruntest -f <gfservice.conf> -d -k ...

gfruntest can also execute multiple testcases using a scenario file.
In the scenario file, testcase names are listed one per line, like:

	gfarm_v2::failover_by_kill
	gfarm_v2::failover_by_reboot
	gfarm_v2::failover_by_stop

Note that lines beginning with '#' and empty lines are ignored.
Then, invoke gfruntest with '-s' option:

	% gfruntest -s <scenario file>

gfruntest assumes <scenario file> exists under the directory:

	$datadir/gfarm/systest/scenarios/

It runs testcases specified in the scenario file successively.

gfruntest records logs output by testcases to the log file 'gfruntest.log'
at the current directory.  To alter the path of the log file, use '-l'
option:

	% gfruntest -l <log file>
