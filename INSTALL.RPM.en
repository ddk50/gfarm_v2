		Gfarm Filesystem Installation Manual

About this document
===================

This document describes the installation of a Gfarm filesystem
using RPM binary packages.

Overview
========

To introduce a Gfarm filesystem, RPM packages for a metadata server,
filesystem nodes, and client nodes have to be installed.

Note that it is possible to install all RPM packages on the same host.

Instruction to build RPM binary packages
========================================

RPM binary packages are built from the RPM source package (SRPM).  To
build the binary packages, development packages of OpenSSL, OpenLDAP
and PostgreSQL are required.


	# yum install openssl-devel openldap-devel postgresql-devel
	# rpmbuild --rebuild gfarm-X.X.X-X.src.rpm

Binary packages are located at /usr/src/redhat/RPM/ARCH/.

To enable the GSI authentication, development packages of Globus
GSSAPI is also required.  Moreover the environment variables
GFARM_CONFIGURE_OPTION should be defined.

	# GFARM_CONFIGURE_OPTION=--with-globus rpmbuild \
		--rebuild gfarm-X.X.X-X.src.rpm

If it succeeds, gfarm-gsi packages (not gfarm packages) are built.  If
not, make sure whether the Globus GSSAPI library is correctly
installed.

Installation of a Gfarm metadata server
=======================================

Install RPM packages for the Gfarm metadata server.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm-server-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-libs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

Note: The binary package names may be gfarm-gsi-* not gfarm-* if the
      Package does include GSI authentication.

Installation of a Gfarm filesystem node (and client node)
=========================================================

Install the RPM packages for a Gfarm filesystem node.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm-fsnode-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-libs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-client-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-doc-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

Since each filesystem node is usually a client node, it is necessary
to install a client package, too.  A document package is optional.

Moreover, if you want to use the GfarmFS-FUSE (gfarm2fs) to mount
the Gfarm filesystem as a client node, the gfarm2fs package is
necessary.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm2fs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

Installation of a Gfarm client node
===================================

Install RPM packages for a Gfarm client node.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm-client-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-libs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm \
		   gfarm-doc-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm

A document package is optional.

If you want to use the GfarmFS-FUSE to mount the Gfarm file system,
install the gfarm2fs package as well.

	# rpm -Uvh gfarm2fs-X.X.X-X.ARCH.rpm
